Books, fictional and nonfictional, have affected me deeply. I will describe what makes these books so important to me.

# The Monkey Wrench Gang *by Edward Abbey*

Often described as more of a written comic book than a novel, Edward Abbey's most popular novel is the story of four environmentalists resolved to tear apart the colonialist systems that seek to conquer their home: the western United States. There's plenty of drama involved but what i value about it, and what has cemented it as a classic is Abbey's obvious love for the Earth that his characters stand upon. The quote I included is one of many flowery descriptions of landscape and a character's peace within it, something I value myself. 

# Disco Elysium *by ZAUM*

This one is not a book, but its got more words than most any novel. It is a critically acclaimed video-game and murder mystery story. It is a also gripping political drama about a world remarkably different that ours, but similar in ways that make it easy to empathize. This world is divided into Isolas, like continents but separated by "The Pale," a supernatural ocean-like empty space that is slowly consuming the world. The isolation that is consuming the continents is also represented in the community that is stricken by a high-profile murder, and as our deuteragonists discover and eliminate leads, they find that loneliness is at the heart of the scourge that is tearing apart their country. A loneliness that was invented by the greed of powerful corporations and institutions. If written works appeal to you more, the lead writer Robert Kurvitz also wrote A Sacred and Terrible Air, for which Disco Elysium is based. 

# Crossing *by Patjim Statovci*

A gripping novel about the desire to escape, loneliness, and identity and how they intersect.
